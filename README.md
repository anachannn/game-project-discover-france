<h2>My first project</h2>

Our first project had to be game. I decided to create a geo quiz about French cities : <b>Discover France.</b>
<br>The goal ? Choose the right location for each city between three locations displayed on the map.
<br>For this project, I had to :
- Organize my datas in a array of arrays of objects
- Create a proper structure on HTML & link all the files
- Design the game board with CSS using position, display & transform
- Build a logic in JS to allow the different scenario to be displayed one after the other (class, functions, addEventListener)
<br><br>I also added relevant features like a <b>score</b> that lead to different end game, some <b>sounds</b> on click (and a switch button to turn it off) and a dynamic <b>timer.</b>
